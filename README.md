This repository is a collection of tips and techniques that I have used over
the years. Some are included so that I can record how I manage my FreeBSD and
Linux machines. Others, because it was hard to solve a problem. And finally,
others because they are interesting or clever.

None of this would have been possible without the World-Wide-Web. So I must
thank the web community for their input. In keeping with this community spirit,
please feel free to use what you can. I hope that you find something useful
here!
