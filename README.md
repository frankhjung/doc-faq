# FAQ

This repository is a collection of tips and techniques that I have used over
the years. Some are included so that I can record how I manage my FreeBSD and
Linux machines. Others, because it was hard to solve a problem. And finally,
others because they are interesting or clever.

The content, however is rather old. Instead I favour the use of
[Dokuwiki](https://www.dokuwiki.org/dokuwiki#). Consequently, new material
appears on my GitHub account [here](https://github.com/frankhjung/doc-wiki).
